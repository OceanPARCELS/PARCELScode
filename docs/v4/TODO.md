# TODO

List of tasks that are important to do before the release of version 4 (but can't be done now via code changes in `v4-dev`).

- [ ] Make migration guide for v3 to v4
- [ ] Just prior to release: Update conda feedstock recipe dependencies (remove cgen and compiler dependencies). Make sure that recipe is up-to-date.
